          Waste management is important as it saves the environment from the
          toxic effects of inorganic and biodegradable element present in waste.
          Mismanagement of waste can cause water contamination, soil erosion and
          air contamination. Waste can be recycled if collected and managed
          efficiently. Waste materials such as plastic, glass and paper can be
          segregated into different columns in order to process them to make new
          products which will save the natural resources.
